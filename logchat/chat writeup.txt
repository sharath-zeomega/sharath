Features of My Chat Application:
________________________________

The app contains real-time chat between two private users
- The chat history can be retirieved later when the chat is accessed by the user
- The chat between two people will not be broadcasted to other users online
- If an active user sends a message to another user while he is offline, the other user will be able to retirieve message later when he accesses the chat


Functionality :
______________

      When a user login, his'her record is maintained in online users collection, and the entire chat history is retrived from the database and displayed
using socket.io.When he sends messages, it's checked if the recipient is online or not. If yes, message is sent to him. If not, nothing happens. In both 
the cases, message is stored in database for later access.When a user disconnects, he'she is  removed from online users database.
