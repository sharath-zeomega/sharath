project name: Task Application

language used: nodejs and javascript

This project is all about entering the tasks and deleting the task,and listing the tasks whicha are entered.

this contains the 4 main files and some configuraton files and one json file to store the tasks which are entered.

index.js

This is the main file ,in this file we will call the functions to perform delete create and list the tasks.

we need to enter some commands to perform functions

to add the task:node index.js addTodo --title="Tasknames"

To list tasks :node index.js listTodos

To delete task:node index.js deleteTodo --title="task you want to delete"

 code that when ever the user enter the command to add the list it will call the fuction and 
add the list to the json file
 
if the entered task is duplicated or already present in the json file it will ignore the task 

the function that will delete the task which are in the json file .

if the task is not present in the json file or mistyped it will display todo not found .

the function that will return the tasks that are present in the json file .

it will also display the no of tasks with the title of the tasks, and count of the task.


tasks-data.json
________________
It is the file that stores all the task enterd by the user .
